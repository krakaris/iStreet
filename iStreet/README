What everyone is working on:

Rishi - caching improvements
Alexa - clubs, pretty-ifying
Aki - CAS / FB / friends

Conventions (uniformity!)
next line curly braces
Use /* ... */ for comments
Use #pragma mark <section_title> to organize related methods
avoid magic numbers!! (use enums...what to do about one-time-use local constants? like kConnectionTimeout)

for the future:
don't forget to delete unnecessary core data objects!!
