What everyone is working on:

Rishi - CAS stuff
Alexa - documents, pretty-ifying
Aki - FB / friends

Conventions (uniformity!)
next line curly braces
Use /* ... */ for method comments and big comments, but // for comment stubs
Use #pragma mark <section_title> to organize related methods
avoid magic numbers!! (use enums...what to do about one-time-use local constants? like kConnectionTimeout?)
ivar = _ivar

for the future:
don't forget to delete unnecessary core data objects!!
carefully handle *EVERY* situation when the wifi might fail. *especially in the chat room*
CAS stuff - ticketed server access?
update timeline!!
make empty cells appear to fill up rest of screen (see icon loading app for details) (even at startup)
